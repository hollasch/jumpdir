    jumpdir: A heuristic change-directory command


    DESCRIPTION

    JumpDir is a heuristic change-directory command that learns about your
    environment as you navigate from directory to directory (including
    network-mapped directories). It is currently in a very preliminary state.


    BUILDING

    For the time being, jumpdir is built with a Visual Studio 'nmake' makefile.
    I will convert it to a true Visual Studio project in the future.
