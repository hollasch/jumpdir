jumpdir
====================================================================================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------
_Jumpdir_ is a heuristic change-directory command that learns about your environment as you navigate
from directory to directory (including network-mapped directories). It is currently in a very
preliminary state. It's based on a tool I wrote many years ago that was quite successful, but for
various reasons I'm re-writing it from the ground up.


BUILDING
--------
For the time being, jumpdir is built with a Visual Studio 'nmake' makefile. I will convert it to a
true Visual Studio project in the future.
